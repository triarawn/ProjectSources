# Roblox Project Sources
An repository for all of the old programs I wrote that are no longer being used, or programs that I wrote for fun and nothing else. Expect bad code, as some of these were written around 2019.

# How do I use these? This way of uploading files is confusing.
Usually a folder for a thing I made has an assembled version of it. Download that and insert it if you don't want to figure out how everything works.

# What's this subfolder inside this folder with the same name as the main script only with a "scripts" next to it?
That right there is the scripts that goes inside the main script.

# Things included right now:
Tiny ROBLOXian Clone Tool Remake

Old version of SB64's engine

Old boss I made's source code

Scooter Simulator Remake I made as a birthday celebration's source code

NASU from Yume Nikki recreation's source code 

Sonic Saturn's source code

A Hattastic Travel's source code 

Ghost Generator plugin & Ghost Playback Helper - Ghost Generator is a plugin that lets you record a gameplay demo, and Ghost Playback Helper is a module that plays back those demos. It was taken down for god knows what reason and forced off the Creator Marketplace. Thank you, Roblox! For taking down an innocent piece of code!

# Will this repository recieve any updates?

Definitely! Whenever I make something for fun or something becomes really old I'll put the source code here for you guys to enjoy.
